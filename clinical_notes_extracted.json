States the pain worsens when he sits in his recliner too long.\n\nCurrent meds: Metformin 500 mg TID, Ibuprofen PRN for back pain, and Lisinopril 10 mg daily for mild hypertension. Last A1C: 8.9%. He\u2019s annoyed that the pharmacy recently changed his pill bottle labels, making them harder to read. \nComplains of slight dizziness upon standing, possibly orthostatic. He also mentions he\u2019s been skipping breakfast, which might contribute to blood sugar swings.\n\nAssessment & Plan: Evaluate orthostatic hypotension. Increase dietary supervision, possibly add short-acting insulin if glycemic control remains inadequate. Suggest physical therapy referral for back pain.",
